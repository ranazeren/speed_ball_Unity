#  Speed Ball (Unity 3D Game)

This is a **3D ball game** developed with **Unity and C#**.  
The player navigates a rolling ball along a path, collects coins, and avoids walls without crashing.  

This project helped me improve my skills in **game mechanics, physics-based controls, collision detection, and UI design**.

- Coin collection system
